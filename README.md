## Project 1 - Data Analysis - Tracing the Ideal Customer Profile

### Scenario:

I work in a retail company which has thousands of different customers...

With the aim of increasing revenue and, consequently, the company's profit, the board wants to identify the ideal type of customer for its products and/or services, based on the customer's purchase history.

For that, it made a job of classifying them with a grade from 1 to 100. But now, I'm in charge of discovering, based on those grades, what that profile would be.

What is your profession(s)? Age groups? And while the lace? Anyway, all the information I can analyze to outline what are the characteristics of the company's best customers.

And, of course, I will use my knowledge in Python and Data Science to resolve this issue. ;)
